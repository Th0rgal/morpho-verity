  Property2 — "if a borrower's LTV is below 1/LIF, a liquidation can put it back
  to healthy."

  morpho-blue did not attempt this: specifying the rounding on the `1/LIF`
  threshold is delicate. We make the statement precise and prove it outright — the
  sharp form is now a theorem (`sharp_property2`), not an open obligation.

  Layout:
    * `LIF` and `ltvBelowInvLif` — transcribed from `liquidate`
      (Morpho/Contract.lean:856-860) and stated division-free. `WAD_le_LIF` /
      `LIF_le_MAX` prove the factor always lies in `[1, 1.15]`; `lltv_lt_invLif`
      proves `lltv < 1/LIF`, so the liquidatable-yet-restorable band is non-empty.
    * `liquidate` / `seizedAssets` — the borrower-side state change and the
      contract-derived seizure, mirroring the field writes in the contract.
    * `liquidation_can_restore_health` — full repayment drives `borrowShares` to 0,
      hence healthy. A complete, axiom-free proof that *a* liquidation suffices.
    * `full_liquidation_affordable` / `sharp_property2` — under `LTV < 1/LIF` the
      full liquidation seizes `≤ collateral` (so it does not revert at
      Contract.lean:885, leaving no bad debt) *and* restores health. This is the
      sharp `1/LIF` guarantee morpho-blue flagged as hard, proved in full. The
      `sharp_property2` docstring records why the *partial* phrasing is the wrong
      invariant (share indivisibility gives a counterexample at `borrowShares = 1`).

    liquidatable yet restorable is non-empty — `SharpProperty2`'s hypothesis is not
    vacuous. The proof needs no case split on the `min`: writing `denom` for the LIF

  **Property 2 (existence).** Repaying the borrower's entire share balance drives
  `borrowShares` to 0, which is healthy by the zero-debt branch — so a liquidation
  can always restore health. (The `1/LIF` threshold is what makes this achievable
  by a *partial*, bad-debt-free liquidation; see below.)

  **Affordability / no bad debt.** Under `LTV < 1/LIF`, fully repaying the
  position seizes no more collateral than the borrower has: `seized ≤ collateral`.
  So the `require(collateral ≥ seizedAssets)` at Contract.lean:885 passes — the
  full liquidation does not revert and leaves no bad debt.

  This is exactly where the `1/LIF` threshold pays off, and every rounding goes the
  favourable way. Writing `cq` for the quoted collateral and `T ≤ borrowed` for the
  floor-rounded repaid assets: `seized` is built by three floors, so
  `seized ⋅ price ≤ S ⋅ 1e36` with `S ⋅ WAD ≤ T ⋅ LIF ≤ borrowed ⋅ LIF < cq ⋅ WAD`,
  giving `S ≤ cq` and hence `seized ≤ collateral`. No case split, no extra
  hypotheses (when `price = 0` the seizure is `0`). -/

  **Property 2 (sharp), proved.** Under `LTV < 1/LIF` the *full* liquidation is
  both feasible (`seized ≤ collateral`, no revert / no bad debt) and health-
  restoring (it drives `borrowShares` to `0`). No obligation remains.

  The earlier *partial* (`repaidShares < borrowShares`) phrasing is unprovable as
  stated: shares are indivisible, so at `borrowShares = 1` the only partial repay is
  `0`, which cannot restore an unhealthy position. Such a state exists (e.g.
  `borrowShares = 1`, `collateral = 120`, `totBorrowAssets = 99999999`,
  `totBorrowShares = 0`, `lltv = 0.8e18`, `price = 1e36`: `borrowed = 100`,
  `maxBorrow = 96 < 100` so unhealthy, yet `borrowed ⋅ LIF ≈ 106.4e18 < 120e18`), so
  the right invariant is *full*-liquidation feasibility, not a partial witness. -/

    `borrowShares = 1` satisfying `LTV < 1/LIF`. `borrowed = 100`, `maxBorrow = 96`
    (so unhealthy), and `borrowed ⋅ LIF ≈ 106.4e18 < 120e18` (so `ltvBelowInvLif`).
    The market totals are well-formed (`borrowShares ≤ totBorrowShares`, so the
    position does not hold more shares than the whole market exists with), to show
    the failure is not an artifact of an unreachable state. -/

/-- **Counterexample to the partial phrasing.** `partialCounterexample` satisfies
    the `1/LIF` hypothesis and is unhealthy, yet no *strict-partial* liquidation
    (`repaidShares < borrowShares`) can restore it: with `borrowShares = 1` the only
    partial repayment is `0`, which merely seizes collateral and cannot help. This is
