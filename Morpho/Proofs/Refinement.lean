  Refinement — the bridge obligations tying the proof model to the contract.

  `Morpho/Proofs/HealthModel.lean` is a *projection* of contract storage, not an
  authority. For the properties to say anything about the real contract, each
  Morpho entrypoint must, restricted to the watched account, match one of the two
  `OpShape` cases of `Property1` after projection. We state those obligations here
  as explicit `Prop`s.

  These are deliberately *specifications*, not `sorry`-backed theorems. The
  abstract `modelStep` section below discharges them at the hand-transcribed model
  level. The `Contract` namespace at the end of this file then closes the gap to
  the generated code: there each entrypoint's `Step` is the *real* executable
  `verity_contract Morpho` body, run to success and projected through
  `Projection.lean`, and the classified shape is discharged from named boundary
  obligations (field locality, the `require(_isHealthy)` guards, arithmetic
  faithfulness) rather than from a parallel model. This is not a second source of
  truth: the body is the contract's own. The residual step-to-EVM-bytecode link
  stays empirical, guarded by the differential tests.

  Stating the obligations this way keeps the boundary honest: the model cannot
  silently diverge from the contract, because the gap is named and enumerated.

  Given the refinement obligation for an entrypoint, Property 1 transfers to the
  real (projected) contract step: a healthy account stays healthy. This is the
  payoff — once `Refines e step` is discharged, no extra health reasoning is
  needed per entrypoint.

  The monotone entrypoints (`supply`, `withdraw`, `supplyCollateral`, `repay`,
  `otherAccount`) land in `MonotoneFor` — collateral does not fall, shares do not
  rise, and the index does not grow (the last two trusted inputs from `Assumptions`).
  The self-guarded entrypoints (`borrow`, `withdrawCollateral`) carry `healthy s'`
  directly from their final `require(_isHealthy)`. `liquidate` carries `¬ healthy s`
  from its `require(!_isHealthy)` guard.

  **#5 resolved.** Property 1, end-to-end on the model steps: composing
  `refines_modelStep` with `property1_for_entrypoint`, every entrypoint preserves a
  healthy watched account under constant price and no accrual. The self-guarded
  cases now derive their post-state health from the entrypoint's final
  `require(_isHealthy)` (threaded through `ModelStep.guarded`), so the former guard
  tautology is now a genuine consequence of the discharged `Refines`.

  Refinement v2 — `Step`s built from the real generated contract bodies.

  The `modelStep` relations above are hand-transcribed. This section removes that
  middle layer: every entrypoint's `Step` is now a *successful run of the actual
  generated body*, projected through `Projection.project`. Nothing hand-written
  stands between the `Step` and the contract. Each classified shape is discharged
  from one or two explicitly named boundaries, which is exactly what the
  differential suite covers:

  - monotone entrypoints (`supply`, `withdraw`, `supplyCollateral`, `repay`,
    `otherAccount`): `MonotoneDiscipline` — a successful run keeps the watched
    position inside the monotone envelope (collateral does not fall, borrow shares
    do not rise, `lltv` fixed);
  - self-guarded entrypoints (`borrow`, `withdrawCollateral`): `GuardedDiscipline`
    — a successful run lands in a healthy post-state, from the final
    `require(_isHealthy)`;
  - `liquidate`: `GuardUnhealthy` (its `require(!_isHealthy)` guard fired) together
    with `HealthFaithful` (the contract bool matches the model predicate).

  The non-liquidate entrypoints. Each `Step` below is the real generated body of

  from one named boundary obligation: the projected field movement a successful
  run guarantees. That obligation is the storage-write-locality fact (a supply
  call does not touch the watched borrow position, a repay does not raise its
  shares, and so on); it is what the differential parity suite checks, named here
  rather than re-derived by symbolic execution of the full body.

  `liquidate`. The step is the real generated body run to success and projected
  at the watched position. Its classified shape is `¬ healthy s`: a liquidation
  is only the right operation on an already-unhealthy position. This is
  discharged from two named boundaries. `GuardUnhealthy` is the contract's own
  `require(!_isHealthy)`: a successful run forces the health test to have
