  HealthModel — proof-only projection of Morpho storage relevant to position health.

  This is NOT a second Morpho contract. It is proof infrastructure: the smallest
  projection of contract storage that the health predicate `_isHealthyWithPrice`
  (Morpho/Contract.lean) reads, together with that predicate transcribed verbatim.

  Faithfulness to the contract is an explicit obligation, discharged per-operation
  in `Morpho/Proofs/Refinement.lean`. Nothing here may be treated as authoritative
  Morpho semantics on its own.

  We model the health arithmetic over `Nat`. The contract computes the same values
  via `mulDivDown`/`mulDivUp` (Morpho/Libraries/MathLib.lean), which wrap through
  `Uint256.ofNat`; under the no-overflow side conditions carried by every
  state-mutating entrypoint (the uint128 `require`s) that wrapping is the identity,
  so the `Nat` model and the contract agree pointwise.

  Projection of the storage a single position's health depends on.

  `borrowShares` / `collateral` are the position fields `(id, account)`;
  the three market-level fields are shared across positions in market `id`;
  `price` is the oracle reading, held in the environment.
